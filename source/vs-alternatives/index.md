<p class="headline"><i class="material-icons" translated>school</i> How is locize different from the alternatives?</p>

When we started work on the locize service we wanted to be more then just another localization as a service offering. While we liked to offer a similar service we choosen to be different in following points:

<p class="headline extra-margin"><i class="material-icons" translated>payment</i> Pricing model</p>

Our pricing model is variable. We prefer to have the pricing to grow with your success. Don't pay to much just by scratching the border of the next bigger plan.

<p class="headline extra-margin"><i class="material-icons" translated>translate</i> Instrumentation</p>

While we offer a [oneliner script solution](/integrate) to get you website translated we offer you the full power of a mature i18n framework ([i18next](http://i18next.com)). So our solution is flexible enough to respond on any demand you have. A living [ecosystem](http://i18next.com/docs/ecosystem/) is there to ensure your success.


<p class="headline extra-margin"><i class="material-icons" translated>loop</i> Versioning</p>

Not only the demands on i18next but our own experience in big cloud projects made it clear that our solution needs to provide support for [versioning](/versioning). You can't really support a software development process without proper versioning.

<p class="headline extra-margin"><i class="material-icons" translated>lock_outline</i> Service lock in</p>

While we hope you're happy with our service we choose not to lock you into our service. We trust in the additional value of our service so you are free to export your translations and use them using i18next.


<p class="headline extra-margin"><i class="material-icons" translated>shop</i> How we integrate 3rd party translation services</p>

If anyhow possible we try to integrate the translation services the way you can profit of the additional features they provide. Depending on service:


- ・ Finalize the project, eg. add additional documents,...
- ・ Choose to work with your preferred translators
- ・ Approve the translations
- ・ Contact with your translator
- ・ ...
