### Context matters

Often doing correct translations needs more information by providing more context information. The best context is always the place where the content is shown - your website.

So we decided to bring the locize project closer to your website / application:

<div class="img-80">
![](/images/editor/editor.png "Screen of InContext Editor")
</div>

Simply turn on this feature by calling your url with appending `?locize=true` (**locizify script > v2.3.0**). On the right hand locize will be opened and you can login as usual. Now you're ready to go â€” click on any content to open that text inside your project.

You can disable the linking by clicking the bottom right button or pressing `ctrl-x`.

### Using with i18next / More options

- Integrating in i18next/locize script
- Using window mode
- Changing querystring

Find more details and configuration options on the [github page](https://github.com/locize/locize-editor).
