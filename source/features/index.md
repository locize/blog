<p class="headline"><i class="material-icons">done</i> Easy to integrate</p>

Getting your website translated is as easy as dropping one line of code to your page.

```html
<script id="locizify" projectid="[PROJECT_ID]" apikey="[API_KEY]" referencelng="[LNG]" fallbacklng="[LNG]" src="/locizify.js" />
```

There is no need for extra infrastructure or tooling.

<p class="headline extra-margin"><i class="material-icons">settings</i> Need more control?</p>

While we recommend to use our locizify script for most cases there might be situations where you need more control.

Never be unsure again. One look is enough to see if your pages are completely translated or not.

<p class="headline extra-margin"><i class="material-icons">loop</i> Versioning</p>
