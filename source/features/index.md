<p class="headline"><i class="material-icons" translated>done</i> Easy to integrate</p>

Getting your website translated is as easy as dropping one line of code to your page.

```html
<script id="locizify" projectid="[PROJECT_ID]" apikey="[API_KEY]" referencelng="[LNG]" fallbacklng="[LNG]" src="/locizify.js" />
```

There is no need for extra infrastructure or tooling.

<p class="headline extra-margin"><i class="material-icons" translated>settings</i> Need more control?</p>

While we recommend to use our locizify script for most cases, there might be situations where you need more control.
