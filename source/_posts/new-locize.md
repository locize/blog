A lot of work may be virtual now, but that doesn’t mean we’ve slowed down! In fact, we spent the last months working on a new locize version with a bunch of fabulous updates. Here's a run-down of some of the most important tweaks that make a huge difference.

# Modernized UI
First of all, you will notice locize looks different. The layout is a little less angular and a little more rounded.
There are more icons and more charts. This makes it look friendlier, simpler, and tidier.

The layout is composed by different cards. Each card has optional additional functionality in the top right corder.

# Different parts
The application was rewritten from the ground up and now splits into two major parts.

## Project pages
The project pages consists of details and actions about your versions, languages, namespaces, etc.

There's also an optional card about your orders and another card about your branched projects (crowdbased and localistars)

We moved everything related to the development to a dedicated page, containing development settings, api keys and relevant metrics. There's also the possibility to configure a webhook or integrate slack.

## CAT pages
The other major part is the new computer aided translation tool – short CAT. The new CAT tool comes with three separate views, for:

### Global overview
With global imports and exports, add, copy or delete keys, search and filter.

### Translation
Focus on translating, assisted by machine translation (MT), smart translation memory (TM), consistency checks, and more.

### InContext editing
The InContext Editor just needs a little script ([locize](https://github.com/locize/locize) or [locizify](https://github.com/locize/locizify)) added to your site, so it can exchange information (clicked text, saved changes, etc.).

# New features
The new locize app does not only come with a new fresh look – but also brings you a ton of new awesome features, like the review workflow or the key history.

## Review
You can enable the review workflow for specific languages.

This way each time someone changes a translation, it will start a review workflow.
The actual value will not be changed until someone will accept one of the translation proposals.

## History
The last translation changes are audited per key.

# Summary
To make it short – every aspect of the old experience was analyzed and improved to give you an even better experience.

The only thing we did not change was the price.

You get all the new features without any increase of costs.
