Simply put, localization in marketing is the process of adapting your marketing material to ensure that it meets the interests and needs of your various target markets. 

Working across a global market means you will be interacting with different cultures and customer expectations. Being able to understand their needs will allow you to effectively translate your material and maximize your chances of converting leads into long-term customers. 


 
## Why is localization in global marketing important? <a name="importance"></a>

Did you know that 50% of <a href="https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/global-ecommerce-statistics" title="online shoppers">online shoppers</a> purchase something from a company that is outside their home country? While globalization is a wonderful way to increase your business, competition is also incredibly tough.

Localization is much more than just translation, though. It is about using the cultural idioms, phrases, and symbolism, helping to increase trust and overall satisfaction.

## How to implement marketing localization in your business <a name="yourbusiness"></a>
Now we have answered the question, “what is localization in marketing?” it is time to look at how you can begin to implement it into your business. This can seem a daunting process, but there are several steps to remember:

**1. Hire the experts**  
Working with professionals is one of the most important steps, as they will have a clear idea of your demographics, the language of your target audience, their culture, and the nuances that will make you sound like a local.

**2. Localize your website**  
Alongside your marketing materials, you should also localize your website. [Over 75%](https://www.english.com/blog/english-language-internet/) of the world’s population does not speak English, so failing to optimize your website for non-English speakers will significantly restrict your reach and sales. 

**3. Humanize your brand**  
Another vital aspect of your localization marketing strategy should be humanizing your brand. When potential customers see your brand engaging in their language, using cultural elements, popular slang and words in their products and services, they are far more likely to complete their purchase.

**4. Use local partners**   
Influencers now play a major role in marketing campaigns for businesses across almost every industry. However, when it comes to localizing your marketing plan, you should look at the partners you are operating with and adapt accordingly to influencers in the local market. 



## Potential mistakes to avoid in global marketing localization <a name="mistakes"></a>

Despite its importance, there are many common mistakes that organizations make in their localization strategy, including:

**Focusing on a universal approach**
One of the most common mistakes is adopting a universal approach. Effective localization is not a one-size-fits-all and requires careful tailoring to ensure your brand is reaching the most effective touch points of your target market.

**Not localizing every aspect**
Another common mistake is only localizing certain aspects, such as print advertising. Neglecting certain areas, such as your socials or website, can lead to customers heading elsewhere. 

**Poor translation** 
Poor translation is another common mistake when it comes to marketing localization. Working with a professional localization partner will ensure that you are not using any embarrassing or incorrect phrasing.

## Exploring successful global marketing campaigns: Examples from known brands <a name="globalexamples"></a>

Transcreation is a term used in the advertising and marketing industry to refer to the process of adapting a message from one language and culture to another while maintaining the intended emotion, tone, and context of the original message. 

It goes beyond just translation as it involves the creative process of rewriting and adapting the message to fit the cultural and linguistic nuances of the target audience, while still conveying the same meaning and impact as the original message.

Transcreation is especially important for global marketing campaigns, where the same message needs to be conveyed across different languages and cultures. It allows companies to effectively communicate their brand message and values to a global audience, while also respecting the unique cultural differences and nuances of each region.

When done effectively, a global marketing campaign can transform a business and propel them onto success. Some great examples include:

**Red Bull**
One of the leading brands in the world, Red Bull can often feel like a local company. Their support of local sporting events, from F1 to Soapbox races, ensures they are continuously being placed in front of their relevant audience. 

**Airbnb** 
Since its launch in 2008, Airbnb has grown from its San Francisco base to become one of the most recognized businesses in the world. Its [“Made Possible By Hosts”](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/made-possible-hosts-airbnb-linh-lai) campaign brought the company into the homes of potential customers across the globe. 

**McDonald’s**
The iconic golden arches of McDonald’s are recognized across the globe, and its marketing efforts are one of the best examples of localization. While the colors and themes remain similar, the fast food chain focuses on using region-specific menus; for instance, the use of flatbreads in the Middle East or Macaroons in France.  


## How to measure global marketing efforts <a name="measure"></a>
While there can be no denying the benefits that come from marketing localization, it is vital that you are effectively measuring your results. 

In order to determine your performance, you should first set yourself some clear goals of what you want to achieve and by when. This will act as your benchmark and will allow you to track whether you are on course to achieve them. 

Of course, one of the biggest factors to consider is your ROI.
