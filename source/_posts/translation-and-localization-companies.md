## How to Find the Best Translation Agency – and What Most People Overlook

Successful localization can dramatically increase your business's reach – achieving a [ROI of over 300%](https://slator.com/how-localization-automation-can-get-companies-a-345-percent-roi/) by partnering with a professional translation and localization provider is not uncommon.


Although translation agencies are plentiful on the market today, the quality varies significantly when you take a closer look. In the end, it’s not always easy to find a Translation and Localization Company that meets your expectations.

This article will cover exactly that: How do you find professional Translation and Localization Companies, why is it so important, and what options are available?

## What is a Translation and Localization Company?

Translation and Localization Companies are service providers specializing in translating content from one language to another. However, their services go beyond traditional translation bureaus. These companies also ensure that content aligns with the cultural, legal, and regional specifics of the target market.

While translation focuses solely on the language aspect, <a href="https://locize.com/blog/localization/" title="localization">localization</a> ensures that texts and other content are relevant and understandable within the specific cultural context.

What does this look like in practice? A Translation and Localization Company doesn’t just adapt the language of a product manual, for example; it also considers local units of measurement, date and currency formats, legal requirements, and cultural preferences.

## Benefits of Working with a Translation and Localization Company

Working with Translation and Localization Companies offers several advantages. The most important is the professional quality and accuracy a Translation and Localization Company provides. Qualified native speakers and experts work together to consider every small cultural nuance of the target market, reducing the risk of misunderstandings and increasing relevance.

For companies offering products in other countries, managing translations can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. A Translation and Localization Company reduces the workload and ensures timely project completion.

Thanks to automated <a href="https://locize.com/?lng=en" title="software localization tools">software localization tools</a> and resources, established Translation and Localization Companies can localize extensive content, such as entire websites or software applications, in a short time. This saves time, especially when rapid market entry in multiple countries is required.

Other advantages of working with Translation and Localization Companies include scalability, technological support, legal compliance, and cost savings. Ultimately, the goal is to deliver tailored content to the market to enhance the user experience and increase the likelihood of product purchases or service bookings. For any globally operating company, a Translation and Localization Company can provide considerable competitive advantages.

## Who Needs a Translation and Localization Company?

Primarily, Translation and Localization Companies are aimed at companies and organizations looking to expand internationally or establish themselves in various markets. Industries such as e-commerce, software, technology, marketing, healthcare, law, and tourism particularly benefit from Translation and Localization Companies, as these areas require content to be adapted for diverse languages and cultures. Besides global players, small and medium-sized businesses entering new markets to maximize their international success potential can also benefit from these services.

## How to Find a Good Translation and Localization Company

Finding a high-quality Translation and Localization Company is not as easy as it may seem. A strategic approach to the search is highly recommended.

**Important**: Define your requirements for the Translation and Localization Company. Here are some questions that may help:

- Which languages and regions need to be covered?
- What type of content (e.g., <a href="https://locize.com/blog/website-localization/" title="website localization">website localization</a> , software- or marketing materials-) should be translated and localized?
- Do you need industry-specific expertise (e.g., medical, technical, or legal knowledge)?
- Are technical tools such as Translation Memory, machine translation, or terminology databases required for your project?

The clearer your needs, the easier it will be to find a suitable provider.

Moreover, a Translation and Localization Company should be able to showcase several successful projects. Experience in this specialized niche is essential. Ideally, the company holds awards or ISO certifications. Also, ensure that either qualified, experienced translators or, even better, professional native speakers work at the Translation and Localization Company. The use of modern tools such as Translation Memory (TM) or Machine Translation (MT) further enhances efficiency.

**Don't Forget**:

- Good communication and reliable customer support with dedicated contacts
- Transparent pricing without hidden costs
- Flexibility to handle urgent requests when needed
- Punctuality and reliability with adherence to all deadlines

A company’s website, listed references, and customer reviews on independent platforms can provide a solid first impression of Translation and Localization Companies. Ideally, the Translation and Localization Company will offer a test project, allowing you to assess their skills and service in detail. Ultimately, the goal is to establish a long-term partnership with the Translation and Localization Company, so take your time in choosing wisely.

## Why Finding the Right Partner Can Be Difficult

As we have often mentioned, finding a professional Translation and Localization Company is not always straightforward. But why is that? Because there is no clear definition, and essentially anyone offering translation, interpretation, subtitling, dubbing, and localization can call themselves a Translation and Localization Company.

Additionally, there is a wide range of providers, from small specialized agencies to large global service providers. You’ll quickly notice that the quality of translations and localizations varies significantly. Often, the first attempt to find a suitable Translation and Localization Company fails because there seems to be no provider with the required industry-specific knowledge, or the pricing structure is vague. The latter is often a sign of unprofessional companies.

Yes, finding the right Translation and Localization Companies requires some effort. However, investing time in this process will pay off when you can work with a professional company in the long term.
