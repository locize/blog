[![](i18next_how_it_works.png)](/i18next.html#how-does-i18next-work)


### B. Unique Features Setting locize Apart <a name="unique-features"></a>

#### 1. Strong Support for Versioning and Software Development Process

One of locize's standout features is its robust support for [versioning](https://docs.locize.com/more/versioning), a critical aspect of software development. Proper versioning ensures that changes to translations are managed efficiently, facilitating collaboration among developers and localization teams. With locize, users can confidently make updates and track progress without the fear of losing previous translations or creating confusion.

#### 2. Freedom from Service Lock-In

Unlike some other translation management services, locize believes in giving users the freedom to choose. While locize offers exceptional value as a TMS, it does not lock users into its platform. Instead, users can export their translations and use them with i18next or other preferred localization frameworks. This approach empowers users with full control over their translation data and enhances the flexibility of their localization workflow.

#### 3. Exceptional Support from i18next Creators

The backing of the i18next creators ensures that locize users receive unparalleled support and expertise in internationalization and localization. The team behind locize is intimately familiar with the intricacies of i18next, providing developers with valuable guidance and assistance in optimizing their localization workflow.

#### 4. Support for Multiple Namespace/Files and Proper Pluralization

locize goes beyond standard translation management offerings by providing support for multiple [namespaces](https://docs.locize.com/more/namespaces) or files within a project. This allows developers to organize translations efficiently, ensuring clarity and simplicity in the localization process.

Additionally, locize understands the complexities of [pluralization rules](https://docs.locize.com/more/general-questions/why-do-i-see-strange-new-keys-marked-as-one-few-many-others) in different languages. By correctly calculating progress in various languages based on distinct pluralization rules, locize ensures that translations are accurate and contextually appropriate, regardless of the language being translated.

#### 5. Integration with Third-Party Translation Services

To cater to diverse user needs, locize offers integration with third-party [translation services](/services.html#translationservices). This feature allows users to leverage additional capabilities provided by these services, such as project finalization, the option to work with preferred translators, approvals, and direct contact with translators. The integration with third-party services streamlines the translation process and allows users to [collaborate effectively with translation professionals](https://docs.locize.com/guides-tips-and-tricks/working-with-translators).

#### 6. Freedom to choose how to serve your translations

While you get most comfort out of using the locize [CDN](https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/cdn-content-delivery-network), your environment might demand you to bundle the translations with your product (eg. offline usage in areas with restricted internet access or with [offline fallback](https://docs.locize.com/more/backend-fallback)).

Using the CDN has three big advantages:
- You can deploy updates to translations without the need to redeploy/rollout a new version of your application.
- During development, testing you can set your versions to auto publishing. Doing so your translation changes are reflected immediately in your application and results in a lot easier development process.
- You can easily set a version to publish in private mode, which means you will need an API key to download your translations. This enables you for example to use locize as before but without leaking any information to the public.

If your product demands to download the translations, because you need or prefer to host or bundle them yourself you can do so. Using our CDN is completely optional and get only billed if you’re using it.
You can download/export the translations using the [API](https://docs.locize.com/integration/api) or the locize UI or the [CLI](https://github.com/locize/locize-cli), also in various [formats](https://docs.locize.com/integration/supported-formats).
