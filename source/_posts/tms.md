## What functions does it require? <a name="functions"></a>

A TMS is made for the purpose of centrally managing translation and <a href="/blog/localization/" title=" localization">localization</a> tasks. Let's examine the six main functions that a translation management platform should have:

1. Managing translation workflows
2. Managing terminology
3. Use translation memory
4. Get the history and numbers
5. Auto machine translation
6. Integration API

### Managing translation workflows

The TMS reduce the amount of manual effort performed during each of the steps. Otherwise, it could be difficult for your managers, translators, and reviewers to coordinate and promptly execute crucial project specifics, which frequently results in a longer time to market.

1. Define what to translate
2. Sending files to translators
3. During translation
4. Receiving files from translators 
5. Maybe review the files

The TMS reduce the amount of manual effort performed during each of the steps. Otherwise, it could be difficult for your managers, translators, and reviewers to coordinate and promptly execute crucial project specifics, which frequently results in a longer time to market.

<p style="color:grey;">
  A good TMS will trigger a review procedure each time a translation is modified. Until one of the translation suggestions is accepted, the actual value won't change.

### Managing terminology

Terminology is the fundamental cornerstone of all translations. To describe objects and form sentences, people use words, phrases, and jargon. 

If your content generation has to be extended, certain criteria for managing material must be established for all parties involved. 

You should keep track of terms that should or shouldn't be translated via a glossary. It exists to facilitate the use of the language that your business likes by human translators.

### Use the translation memory
A TMS's translation memory feature is especially crucial since it greatly boosts the productivity of language localization <a href="/blog/language-localization/" title="language localization">language localization</a>. 

You can utilize words and phrases from previous work rather than coming up with new language every time. To assist human translators, sentences that have already been translated are stored in a database called a translation memory (TM).


### Get the history and numbers 
Every project management tool must provide the most crucial indicators about budget, progress, and other factors.

The majority of the tasks are contained in one program by the TMS. As a result, reporting the numbers is a must. The data insights from the TMS help improve the administration of your localization projects.

Additionally, keeping track of all previous translations might be helpful. In the event of an inconvenience, it is possible to demonstrate at any moment who made what changes and when.

Locize, our translation management system, offers an overview of the control center with the key figures for the ongoing project:



The control center of our <a href="/" title="localization software">localization software</a> displays all pertinent high-level data:

- user management
- billing (customer details, billing history, budget limit, ...)
- project settings (slack integration, webhook, integration metrics, ...)
- ordering (services, pending orders)
- branches
- project health and metrics


### Auto Machine Translation

With this capability, the TMS attempts to entirely automate the translation process. Traditionally, an application program interface (API) is used to connect translated texts to an engine that handles the translation automatically. 

Because the results from artificial intelligence are typically not 100% fine, a translator is frequently needed to evaluate the auto translation output.

For locize, the entire automatic machine translation process occurs in the backend, which means you'll see the translated result after saving the new keys in reference language.


#### Should you choose machine translation, a translation agency or a freelancer?
These are three options when there is a need of translating content. Whether to engage a translation agency, a freelancer, or make use of machine translation. 

Machine translation would be the most cost-effective approach because it is virtually free. However, if no one reviews the translated information, there will undoubtedly be a lack of transaltion quality.

Freelance translators are frequently enthusiastic about their work. They are frequently subject specialists who can execute sophisticated translations in their fields. This might be a wonderful alternative for those on a restricted budget. Working with a person rather than a firm is less expensive, and you don't have to sacrifice quality.

Translation agencies have greater resources to devote to your job than a freelancer. In addition, they offer a wide range of translation and localization services. They have extensive expertise in assisting you to overcome linguistic and cultural difficulties.

You will discover your ideal match for sure.

### Integration API

API technology is used by excellent TMS to connect to and interact with cloud-based services. This enables it to automate and expand translation management in any content management system for all content kinds.

There is thorough documentation for locize on how to utilize an API to integrate any of your applications. The documentation may be found at [docs.locize.com/integration/api](https://docs.locize.com/integration/api).


## Benefits of using a TMS <a name="benefits"></a>

Manual transmission and receipt of translated texts is inefficient for bigger projects and may result in unstructured chaos and significant financial loss. If regular spreadsheets are inadequate for managing the volume of material, the TMS is for you.

Because a good TMS is 

- Highly scalable
- Easy to integrate
- Easy to understand
- Help with professional translation
- Unleash localization progress
- Notifies whenever something significant occurs

In any event, if a company need expert translation for its own brand material, it makes sense to employ a TMS to make the translation process much easier. 

On the surface, it appears to be a large investment, but upon closer inspection, the investment will pay for itself many times over as the process becomes much more efficient and dependable.

It's also how larger businesses do it; they have content management systems (CMS) as independent but linked applications or as simple add-ons that can meet particular multilingual requirements.


## How translation management helped businesses in achieving success <a name="businesses"></a>

Through the adoption of a Translation Management System (TMS), these enterprises harnessed enhanced productivity, cost-efficiency, and revenue growth, highlighting the TMS's transformative role in their success.

### 30% more projects achieved with the same team

Think of a company that does all of its translation work by hand. They automate project procedures after putting in place a TMS, which significantly shortens project turnaround times. Weeks-long tasks can now be finished in a matter of days. This increased productivity enables the business to reallocate important resources, which is especially important in a situation when there is a shortage of trained labor. For instance, Company A reports a 25% gain in revenue in addition to completing 30% more tasks per month after implementing a TMS.

### 20% lower expenses to reinvest in growing the company
Without a TMS, project management can be labor-intensive and costly. By simplifying project administration and automating key tasks, a TMS minimizes administrative overhead. For example, Company B cut its project management costs by 20% after implementing a TMS, directly contributing to profit growth. These cost savings can be reinvested in business expansion, technology upgrades, or boosting the bottom line.


### 25% increase in revenue as demand rises
Company C was looking to expand its client base and take on more translation projects. However, they were concerned about managing increased workloads effectively. By adopting a TMS with robust scalability, they could effortlessly accommodate the growing demand. The TMS allowed them to streamline workflows and maintain efficiency as their client base expanded. The result? A 25% growth in revenue within a year.



### 40% more recurring business with higher quality
Consistency and quality in translation are pivotal to client satisfaction. By storing translation memories and terminology databases, a TMS ensures consistent, high-quality translations. When clients receive accurate and reliable translations on every project, they become loyal customers. For instance, Company D witnessed a 40% increase in repeat business due to the improved quality of translations made possible by their TMS.


### 20% of revenue boost in global markets
Company E was focused on a domestic market. However, they wanted to tap into international markets. With a TMS, they were able to translate their content into multiple languages, opening doors to new global markets. They experienced a 20% revenue boost in the first year alone by entering untapped regions and reaching a wider audience.
