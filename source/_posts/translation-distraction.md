You may find yourself in a situation where you need to create a multilingual website or application. When that happens, you'll inevitably encounter the issue of translation. While translation is essential, it can also be distracting, especially when you're working on a project with many moving parts.

As a developer, you're no stranger to the challenges of creating software that is accessible to a global audience. Internationalization, or [i18n](../what-is-i18n/), can be a daunting task that involves creating software that can easily adapt to different languages and cultures. But while it's important to prioritize i18n in your [development process](../help-tech-leads/), it's also important not to let translation issues distract you from your primary goal.

## Introduction <a name="intro"></a>

As a developer, your primary focus is on writing clean, functional code that delivers the desired features and functionality to your end users. However, when it comes to multilingual projects, you may find yourself distracted by translation issues. This is because translation requires a significant amount of attention, planning, and resources, which can [pull you away from your core responsibilities](../help-tech-leads/).

In this article, we'll explore why translation issues can be a distraction, how that distraction affects your productivity, and how to manage it effectively.


## Why translation topics can distract you as a developer <a name="why"></a>

Translation topics can be a distraction because they require a considerable amount of attention and planning. When you're working on a multilingual project, you have to consider things like language-specific formatting, text expansion, the possibility of mistranslation and [a lot more](../hidden-localization-costs/).

Additionally, the translation process involves collaborating with different stakeholders, such as translators, editors, and proofreaders, which can consume a lot of your time and energy. This can cause you to lose focus on your primary tasks, leading to delays in your project's delivery.

One of the primary reasons that especially internationalization ([i18n](../what-is-i18n/)) can be frustrating for developers is its complexity. Internationalization is a multi-faceted process that involves everything from designing flexible user interfaces to handling different date and time formats. For large and complex software systems, this can be a time-consuming and challenging task.

This can be summarized with the question: "[Is your software ready for localization?](../is-your-software-ready-for-localization/)"

Incomplete or inaccurate translations can lead to a poor user experience for non-native speakers, and ongoing maintenance to [keep translations up-to-date](../continuous-development-integration-and-localization-cd/) can be resource-intensive. In addition, a lack of testing for i18n can make it difficult to identify and fix bugs that occur when the software runs in different languages or cultures.

## The impact of distraction on your productivity <a name="impact"></a>

Distractions can have a serious impact on your productivity. When you're not focused, you tend to make more mistakes and your work takes longer to complete. This can lead to missed [deadlines and frustrated stakeholders](../help-tech-leads/#situations).

In addition, distractions can affect your creativity, making it harder for you to come up with innovative solutions to problems. This can limit your ability to deliver a quality product that meets the needs of your users.



## How to manage translation-related distractions <a name="manage"></a>

Managing translation-related distractions is essential to ensuring that you stay focused on your core tasks. Here are some strategies you can use:

### Simplify the translation process <a name="simplify"></a>

One way to deal with translation-related distractions is to simplify the translation process. You can do this by using [translation tools](../tms/) that automate certain aspects of the process, such as [translation memory and glossaries](../localization-context/#context-features).

### Delegate translation tasks to others <a name="delegate"></a>

Another way to manage translation distractions is to delegate translation tasks to others. You can hire professional translators, editors, and proofreaders to handle the translation process while you focus on your core business. Or better yet, use a modern translation management system like [locize](/) that takes the pain out of the translation process. No more delays in shipping your software due to missing translations. Translators can keep up with changes from day one. The continuous localization process keeps pace with your demanding business.
A [tms](../i18n-l10n-t9n-tms/) like [locize](https://locize.com) bridges the gap between localization and development. This makes you faster, more efficient and saves you money overall.

### Use machine translation <a name="machinetranslation"></a>

Using machine translation is another way to manage translation-related distractions. While machine translation is not always accurate, it can be useful for translating simple text or getting a rough idea of the content.

The [on-demand machine translation](https://docs.locize.com/different-views/global#bulk-actions) or [automatic machine translation](https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/auto-machine-translation) options are a good example of how machine translation can be used.

Machine translation would be the most cost-effective approach because it is virtually free. However, if no one checks the translated information, there will undoubtedly be a lack of quality. But modern TMS like locize can help you with this. Read more about it [here](https://docs.locize.com/guides-tips-and-tricks/working-with-translators).


## The importance of staying focused on your core tasks <a name="focus"></a>

As a developer, your primary focus should be on writing clean, functional code that delivers the desired features and functionality to your end users.

It's important to remember that internationalization is an essential aspect of software development. By making your software accessible to a global audience, you can [reach new markets](../grow-online-business/) and [make your product more widely used](../localization-strategy/). But it's also important to stay focused on your main goals and not let translation issues distract you from delivering a quality product.

To ensure that internationalization doesn't distract you from your primary goals, it's important to prioritize it in your development process. By making i18n a fundamental part of your software design, you can create a product that is easier to adapt to different languages and cultures. This can include everything from using a localization platform like [locize](/) to conducting thorough testing and [working closely with translation teams](https://docs.locize.com/guides-tips-and-tricks/working-with-translators).


## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

Translation issues can be a significant distraction, but it's important to manage these distractions so you can focus on your core tasks. By simplifying the translation process, delegating tasks to others, and using [smart tools](../i18n-l10n-t9n-tms/), you can free up more time and energy to focus on writing clean, functional code that delivers the desired features and functionality to your end users. Remember to stay focused on your core responsibilities to ensure that you deliver a quality product that meets the needs of your users.
