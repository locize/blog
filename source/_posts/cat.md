## What are CAT tools? <a name="what"></a>
These handy little programs are like having a personal translator in your pocket (or on your computer, whichever you prefer).

But what exactly is a [CAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_translation), you ask? Well, it's pretty much exactly what it sounds like. It's software that helps you translate text from one language to another. Think of it like having a bilingual friend who you can text whenever you come across a word or phrase you don't understand.

Now, I know what you might be thinking: "But wait, don't we already have [Google Translate](../google-translate-accuracy/)?" And yes, you're right! Google Translate is a great tool for quick and easy translations. But CATs are a bit different. They're specifically designed for professional translators and are much more powerful than your average online translator.

## What computer assisted translation tools can do? <a name="features"></a>

Computer-assisted translation tools offer a range of capabilities to streamline and enhance the translation process:


### Glossary Management
One of the most important features of CATs is their ability to "remember" translations. So, if you're working on a big project and you keep coming across the [same phrase](https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/glossary) over and over again, the CAT will remember how you translated it the first time and will automatically use the same translation for all future instances. This can save you a lot of time and make your translations much more consistent.

### Translation Memory
Another great feature of CATs is their ability to work with "[translation memories](https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/translation-memory)". These are databases of previously translated text, which can be used to help speed up the translation process and ensure consistency. So, if you're translating a document and you come across a sentence that's already been translated before, the CAT will pull up the previous translation and suggest it to you. Pretty cool, right?

### Machine Translation
Among the most crucial capabilities of CATs is their adeptness at memorizing translations. Picture this: amidst a large-scale project, encountering recurring phrases is inevitable. Here's where CAT tools shine. They diligently store these translations, committing them to memory. So, the next time you stumble upon that same phrase, fear not! Your trusty CAT tool will recall precisely how you translated it the first time. Seamlessly, it will apply the same translation across all subsequent instances, sparing you valuable time and ensuring impeccable consistency throughout your translations.

### Collaboration
In the realm of CATs, the ability to collaborate seamlessly stands out as a cornerstone feature. Imagine this scenario: you're part of a dynamic translation team, dispersed across different locations, yet working towards a common goal. CAT tools serve as the virtual hub where translators, editors, and stakeholders converge in real-time. Through robust collaboration tools, communication flows effortlessly, files are shared effortlessly, and version control is maintained meticulously. Whether you're providing feedback, making revisions, or simply brainstorming ideas, these tools ensure that every member of the team remains synchronized and empowered to contribute their expertise. As a result, collaboration becomes not just a process but a catalyst for achieving unparalleled translation outcomes.

## Benefits of using CAT tools for translation <a name="benefits"></a>

So, to sum it up, CATs are like having your own personal translator who never forgets anything and can access a vast library of translations. If you're a professional translator, they're an absolute must-have tool. And if you're not, they can still be a handy tool to have around for those times when you need to translate something quickly and easily.

However, what precisely are these amazing technologies capable of, and how might they help you? Let us examine the various benefits and features of computer-assisted translation as we go deeper into this field.

### Efficiency
There is an unmatched efficiency in the field of CAT tools. Imagine being able to move quickly through projects by reusing previously translated segments thanks to the power of translation memory. This simplified procedure not only expedites your work but also frees up valuable time to concentrate on polishing your translations to excellence.

### Accuracy
CAT tools are known for their precision. Think about this: you have a vast array of automated recommendations at your disposal as you utilize the machine translation integration. However, the final translation is guided by your perceptive eye, making sure that every word conveys the intended meaning. Accuracy is not only an objective when you have CAT tools on your side; it is a standard that is steadfastly maintained.

### Time Savings
CAT tools are a match for time, that elusive resource. Imagine this: you can translate words with never-before-seen speed as you take use of glossary management and translation memory. What used to take hours now only takes minutes, allowing you to spend more time refining your craft without worrying about running out of time.

### Cost Savings
When it comes to CAT instruments, precision and efficiency work together to produce substantial cost savings. Think about this: more productive workflows reduce the need for time-consuming manual translations. Every translation project becomes an accomplishment to the wise investment made in CAT tools as you maximize your resources and reduce the margin for mistake, opening you a world of unmatched value and affordability.


## TMS and CAT tools, what is different? <a name="tms"></a>
TMS and CAT tools play distinct roles in translation workflows, with CAT often being a component of TMS. <a href="https://locize.com/blog/tms/" title="Translation management systems (TMS)">Translation management systems (TMS)</a> oversee project logistics, while Computer-Assisted Translation (CAT) tools provide specialized support to translators. CAT tools, commonly integrated within TMS platforms, offer features like translation memory and glossary management, enhancing efficiency and consistency in translation tasks.
