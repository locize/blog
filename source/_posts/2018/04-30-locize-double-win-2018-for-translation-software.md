Efficient localization need not to be expensive, disorganized, and time-consuming for development and localization teams. We designed locize with this core ideas in mind, and a popular software review platform has recently recognized our efforts and affirmed that we have succeeded in our endeavor. FinancesOnline recently distinguished [locize](https://reviews.financesonline.com/p/locize/) with the **Great User Experience** and **Rising Star** awards for 2018 due to our localization and internationalization software’s capability to satisfy the large demands of global businesses.

locize earned FinancesOnline’s **Great User Experience** award under their [best translation software](https://translation.financesonline.com/) for our offering an incredibly pleasing to use software for continuously localizing all kinds of languages and software. Project versioning for easy tracking of file changes, multiple file management and project progress tracking through the dashboard, and third-party integrations are some of the factors that contributed to this award. Their experts also praised our platform’s flexibility and responsiveness reflecting all translations on one’s website by simply embedding a single line of code, a feature that makes locize among the best [translation software competitors](https://financesonline.com/top-10-alternatives-one-hour-translation-popular-translation-software-solutions/). This also negates the need for manual inputting of all translations.
