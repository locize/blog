![Website Localization Fundamentals & Examples](website-localization.webp "Website Localization Fundamentals & Examples")


This article gives you an idea about <b>website localization</b>, this is the process of <b>adapting an existing website to the language and culture of a target market</b>. It is part of internationalization and localization and entails much more than just simple text translation; it must take into account all language and cultural variables. If you are selling a decent product in your home market, it is possible that you are also doing so in other countries. If you wish to sell in Spain, for example, your information must be translated into an adapted message in their original language. This article is specific for websites, if you need more general information, check out our blogpost about [software localization](http://localhost:4000/blog/what-is-software-localization/). Otherwise, keep reading because the information in this post will save you time during your intended endeavor.

You understand what website localization is? Now, let's find out why it's important:


 
## Why a good outcome is important <a name="good-outcome"></a>

A good website localization may help multinational businesses establish significant brand awareness outside of their home country. <b>People on the internet clearly desire to buy from websites in their own language</b>, as evidenced by several [studies](https://insights.csa-research.com/reportaction/305013126/Marketing). Many firms utilize landingpages for a specific area to provide basic corporate information. This is not the strategy to take since the target audience may perceive a lack of enthusiasm for their location and requirements. Local customers anticipate a website that is identical to the one in your primary market.

The localization of a <b>website can increase the revenue</b> of your company. It appears to be an administrative concern in most circumstances, but it is an investment in yourself and your organization.
 
## Prepare the localization of your website <a name="half-done"></a>

Look for a good preparation of your localization strategy, because it will end up in more than just translate some sentence. This process should be part of your overall business strategy, because there are many non-technical-aspects to consider when going into new markets:


### A step-by-step checklist for the business questions

  ➡️ Examine the market - is there a possible audience?

  ➡️ Determine the local compliance needs

  ➡️ Determine the best technology for localization

  ➡️ Determine how we will market in the new place

  ➡️ Decide who is part of the team (lead project manager, marketing expert, developer, etc.)

  ➡️ Construct a list of quality assurance criteria


If you come up with a strong plan and take into account all of the above checkpoints. Then it's time to go more into the webpage's details.


### Here a list of techniques to use <a name="techniques"></a>

Keep the following techniques in mind for a successfull implementation:

* Place the language selector correctly
* Change the formatting design - a sentence in some languages can be substantially longer
* The curreny should be according to customer need
* Think about the update of graphic and videos
* Ensure a proper information achitecture
* Make it easy to update content
* Think about SEO-Localization - SEO should be done parallel to development (industry standard)
* Allow website integrations
* Verify the translations and results


### Elements to consider on website 

This list gives you an overview about what you need to keep an eye on when internationalize your website:

* the text
* the date and time formats
* the unit of measurement
* the holiday seasons
* the local currency
* the methods consumer can pay 
* the way an address is written
* the local letters, symbols, grammar, etc.
* the plurals
* the phone numbers
* the privacy policy
* the images
* the videos


All information must be given in a genuine manner to other locals so that they feel it is tailored to them. Also, the website's navigation may vary as visitors from different regions engage differently with your website. Gender-specific words can also be another possibility, which we do not discuss in detail here, but take that in mind. Understanding the language is frequently insufficient, because people will not buy from a webpage in English if it is not their first language. The material must reflect all of their familiar conditions, not just the language. 


## Examples <a name="examples"></a>


There are well-known examples all across the world of <b>companies that have effectively implemented multilingual websites</b> as part of their overall business strategy. [www.tesla.com](https://www.tesla.com/) was one of the most well-known examples we checked out. They offer a large number of regions from which to choose. They also adjust things like privacy policies and graphics to meet the needs of different locations. They do an excellent job of localizing their website, but it isn't perfect, and there are certain areas where they could improve. 

The following improvements are some general areas that, in the author's view, may be improved by not deeply analyzing their situation. 

##### First finding 
In the author's opinion, the language selector is difficult to discover and therefore not well situated for a good website-experience. It's great that the website displays it based on IP address in advance.

##### Second finding 
In the author's opinion, although switching languages is possible, the user does not receive sufficient tailored info for his intended location. The available Tesla Store Locations are hidden in a bottom menu and are difficult to find. It may help to direct the user's attention to these Locations, allowing the consumer to feel more home.

##### Third finding 
In the author's opinion, some product description information is tailored to a larger geographic area, such as Europe. It isn't particular to different areas of Europe; they used the same data across many countries. However, this may be wanted from them, because the efforts would be excessive in comparison to the results they would get. "The product speaks for itself".

## Quality ensurance <a name="quality"></a>

The quality check is essential for the team to get a measurement of where the project is standing in order to provide the correct website-experience. As a result of this, improving any project milestones or refining website content will be beneficial. This should also contain a check to see if the translators did a good job. In some circumstances, contemporary technology such as machine translation will automate the procedure. As a result, human monitoring can assure not only the quality of the language on the website, but also its functionality and site experience.

We have the following two areas of testing for localization in the web:

### Language Testing
Is the language properly tested, and are all of the words correct and understood? This list may be of assistance:

* Wrong use of language
* Spelling mistakes
* Restricted words in a culture
* Non readable sentence
* Language Errors


### Localization Testing
Testing the localization ensures that your various language site versions work properly. Distribute your testers by newly targeted markets. Check the operation of all web forms and checkout functionality. Also if there is any broken design to fix. A short list you can find below:

* Check for non-translated strings 
* Long website loading times 
* Wrong date and time format discovered 
* Check for broken strings 
* Check hardware compatibility 
* Ensure Hyperlinks operate 
* Form and Checkout features must be tested
