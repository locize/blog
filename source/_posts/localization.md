<p style="color:grey;">Localization involves adapting a product or service to align with the language, culture, or preferences of a specific audience.

For international brands and organizations, it is essential in helping to give their customers the very best experience possible. An effective localization-process can transform a business, helping to increase reach and maximize engagements, but what exactly is it?

## What does localization mean <a name="concept"></a>

So while language translation is the process of converting written content from one language into another, localization goes beyond this. It will look at things such as:

### Language
Translating text and ensuring it's culturally appropriate, considering idiomatic expressions, slang, and terminology specific to the target language.

### Content Adaptation
Adapting content to align with the cultural norms, beliefs, and values of the target audience. This includes imagery, symbols, colors, and references that might be sensitive or offensive in a particular culture.

### Regional Preferences
Customizing the product or content to cater to regional preferences, such as date formats, currencies, units of measurement, and other regional differences.

### User Interface (UI)
Adjusting the user interface, layout, and design to accommodate different languages and reading directions (e.g., right-to-left for Arabic or Hebrew).

### Legal and Regulatory Compliance
Ensuring that the product or content complies with local laws, regulations, and industry standards.

### Functionality
Modifying features or functionality that may not be relevant or practical in the target market or adding features that are specific to that market.

### Testing
Rigorously testing the localized product or content to identify and resolve issues related to linguistic, cultural, or technical aspects.


Localization is a crucial strategy for businesses of all sizes because it makes their content more appealing to the audience they are trying to reach. The process of first enabling a product to be localized, then localizing it for various national audiences is sometimes know as <a href="/blog/globalization-vs-localization/" title="globalization">globalization</a>.

According to [this article](https://insights.csa-research.com/reportaction/305013126/Marketing) 40% of consumers have said that they will never purchase from a website that wasn’t in their native language. While 75% have said that they would be more likely to use a business again if their aftersales care was in their native language.

With the help of this article, you can learn how to adapt your service or product to a specific language, culture, or target market, regardless of the industry you work in. 

Additionally, we will explain how to adapt content or products for various markets and geographical areas.

But first, let's look at some successful examples of well-known brands using it.

## Real-life examples of successful localization-efforts <a name="examples"></a>

    <h3>Business Example</h3>
    <p>Internationalization is becoming increasingly more common, and businesses are now interacting with clients and customers from across the globe. Localization should now be an essential part of their growth strategy, covering everything from company websites and marketing materials to legal documents and product manuals.</p>
    <p>One great example of this is Airbnb, which has successfully been able to expand its business into over 220 countries, each one offering a personal and localized touch to the consumer.</p>

    <h3>Software Example</h3>
    <p>Localization is also a vital strategy in the world of software development. Everything from user experience to overall design will need to be considered to ensure that customers are getting the very best experience.</p>
    <p>A good example of software-localization is Netflix. The global streaming giant has become synonymous with efforts on both the translation side of things and on the developer side. The technology and processes that they utilize are translated and localized in every region, meaning the interface and apps change, as do the subtitles and voice dubbing of content. Even the films and TV shows they develop are localized for specific countries.</p>

## What are the goals of localization  <a name="goal"></a>
The ultimate goal is to develop a clear user experience that helps to drive your marketing and support you in achieving your goals. However, there are many benefits that can come from implementing it, including:

#### Enter new markets 
One of the main goals of a <a href="/blog/localization-strategy" title="localization-strategy">localization-strategy</a> is to help brands to easily enter new markets. It will help overcome any logistical or legal hurdles, ensuring smooth communication across every partner. 


#### Secure a competitive edge 
Implementing localization can also help companies to develop a competitive edge. Going against competitors in a local market can be incredibly challenging as they often have the trust of local audiences. It will help you to build that trust, giving you the edge. 

#### Improve customer satisfaction 
Another important goal is that it helps to improve customer satisfaction. When they are seeing content in their own language and in a style they are more comfortable with; they are more likely to buy or use your products and services. 

#### Increase brand loyalty 
When you are able to improve customer satisfaction, you will also increase brand loyalty. Communicating with customers in their own language and style will help you to secure their trust, increasing the likelihood of them returning. 

#### Maximize your profit
Above all, though, the main goal of a strategy is to help companies maximize their profit. When reach a much bigger and truly global audience you need to engage with them in a personal way, that you maximize the number of customers and in the end also the revenue.
