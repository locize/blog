### What is localization? <a name="intro"></a>

Often confused with language translation, localisation is a far more comprehensive process. The use of it is about adapting your entire content so that it meets the norms and expectations of a specific location or market. 

So while language translation is the process of converting written content from one language into another, localisation goes beyond this. It will look at things such as:

-	How graphics and overall design impacts usability and expectations
-	Which content needs amending to suit your target market
-	Converting things such as measurements and currencies into the correct local format 
-	Formatting dates, telephone numbers, and addresses accordingly 
-	Rewriting content and amending spellings to suit your chosen audience 
-	Making sure all content meets the local and legal regulations 

Localization is an important strategy for organizations of all sizes and helps to make their content more appealing to their target audience. 

According to [this article](https://insights.csa-research.com/reportaction/305013126/Marketing) 40% of consumers have said that they will never purchase from a website that wasn’t in their native language. While 75% have said that they would be more likely to use a business again if their aftersales care was in their native language.

No matter what industry you work in, with this article get an idea on how it can help your business. And we will give you some tools to the hand which can transform your business.


### Examples by type <a name="examples"></a>

A good example of <a href="/blog/what-is-software-localization/" title="software-localization">software-localization</a> is Netflix. The global streaming giant has become synonymous with efforts on both the translation side of things and on the developer side. The technology and processes that they utilize are translated and localized in every region, meaning the interface and apps change, as do the subtitles and voice dubbing of content. Even the films and TV shows they develop are localized for specific countries.

### What is the goal of localization  <a name="goal"></a>
The ultimate goal is to develop a clear user experience that helps to drive your marketing and support you in achieving your goals. However, there are many benefits that can come from implementing it, including:

#### Enter new markets 
One of the main goals of a <a href="/blog/localization-strategy" title="localization-strategy">localization-strategy</a> is to help brands to easily enter new markets. It will help overcome any logistical or legal hurdles, ensuring smooth communication across every partner. 


#### Secure a competitive edge 
Implementing localization can also help companies to develop a competitive edge. Going against competitors in a local market can be incredibly challenging as they often have the trust of local audiences. It will help you to build that trust, giving you the edge. 

#### Improve customer satisfaction 
Another important goal is that it helps to improve customer satisfaction. When they are seeing content in their own language and in a style they are more comfortable with; they are more likely to buy or use your products and services. 

#### Increase brand loyalty 
When you are able to improve customer satisfaction, you will also increase brand loyalty. Communicating with customers in their own language and style will help you to secure their trust, increasing the likelihood of them returning. 

#### Maximize your profit
Above all, though, the main goal of a strategy is to help companies maximize their profit. When reach a much bigger and truly global audience you need to engage with them in a personal way, that you maximize the number of customers and in the end also the revenue. 


### How can it be done? <a name="process"></a>
While there can be no denying the many benefits that come from incorporating localization, it can be a complex procedure. The first thing that you need to do is to determine if the content that you are needing to adapt. Working with a professional will help you to identify those areas which will need to be changed, such as the written content, the images being used, the currency and date formats, etc. 

Identifying these changes often requires comprehensive research into the culture and behaviors of your new target audience. However, it is a worthwhile task and can be incredibly rewarding when completed. 

Once you have identified what changes are required, it is then time to begin making these changes. This can be a very time-consuming process and should be left to the professionals. The project-team will carefully translate, edit and proofread the entire material to ensure that local consumers will have the very best experience possible. 

When all of those changes have been made, they will then need to go through an extensive Quality Assurance process. This will see language professionals going through all of your content with a very fine toothcomb, highlighting and fixing any errors to guarantee a seamless end product for customers. 

No matter whether you are looking to localize your website, marketing material, legal documents, or computer game, working with a professional team will help to make the process as smooth as possible. However, in order to get the best results from your strategy, it is essential that you understand who your target audience is. This will allow you to ensure that your content is always working to convert potential customers into loyal clients.
