Let's begin by having an understanding of the purpose of app localization.


## What is mobile app localization? <a name="what"></a>
In this highly connected digital world, globalization is an essential part of any business. Being able to effectively reach and engage with customers around the world is crucial, especially for mobile app developers. 

With the rise of smartphones, apps have become a core part of our daily lives. From ordering food to watching films, research has shown that over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/271644/worldwide-free-and-paid-mobile-app-store-downloads/" title="230 billion mobile apps">230 billion mobile apps</a>  were downloaded in 2021 alone. 

This extensive use means localization of an app is crucial in ensuring your products can reach consumers anywhere in the world. What is this localization, though, and how can it help?

 
## Make your app scalable with localization <a name="scale"></a>
Mobile-app-localization is a highly beneficial aspect of any business. This is a unique process that requires you to adapt your app so that it can be used by consumers in a wide range of localities. 

This could require adapting the wording so that it is in the right language, or even changing the layout to suit the target market. With nearly [five billion smartphone users](https://www.statista.com/statistics/274774/forecast-of-mobile-phone-users-worldwide/) in the world, the localization of apps ensures that your product can be enjoyed by customers no matter where they might be located.

## What is the difference between localization and internationalization? <a name="term"></a>
Localization and internationalization are two vital strategies for any business, but many people often confuse the two. While they are two similar methods and both rely on each other, they do have two very different approaches. 

Internationalization is the process of adapting your mobile app code so that it can be easily modified and adapted into the required language. On the other hand, localization is the process of actually customizing the content so that it meets the expectations of the chosen destination. 

This means that internationalization needs to happen first, ensuring that mobile app coding is ready to meet the adaptations of localization.

## What is the process of localization? <a name="process"></a>

While there can be no denying the many benefits that come from localization, it is a comprehensive and time-consuming task. To help you, we have taken a closer look at the process:


### 1)  	Planning 
The first stage of any localization strategy is to ensure that you focus on your planning.This process should cover:

<ul>
  <li>deciding which countries and regions to target with your app localization efforts.</li> 

  <li> the research into the languages you are looking to focus on, how you will do this, and what requirements are needed to successfully meet the demands of your target audience.</li> 
</ul>



 
### 2)  	Execution 
Once you have comprehensively planned your <a href="/blog/localization-strategy" title="localization strategy">localization strategy</a> for the app, the next step is to execute the changes. This should be taken with the utmost care and attention, carefully working through every aspect and feature of the app to ensure that they are meeting the requirements. 

Here are some examples: 

<ul>
  <li>Translate your app's title, description, and keywords into the target language to improve visibility and search ranking in local app stores.</li> 

  <li>Adapt your app's screenshots and videos to better fit the cultural preferences and expectations of local users.</li> 
</ul>

[The coming chapter](#appstore) gives you the full list of potential optimizations for a mobile app.


### 3)  	Testing 
With the translations made, you need to ensure that you are conducting a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure that it meets the exact requirements of your target audience.  A beta test is the most effective way of doing this. 

Beta testing is the process of having the app reviewed by native speakers of your target demographics, having them review the copy and design. This should not be rushed, and you should be methodical with your beta testing to guarantee the very best result. 

<ul>
  <li style="padding: 1rem 0">Test your app with real users in your area, and ask them to give you feedback on the localization as they use it.</li> 

  <li style="padding: 1rem 0">Verify text and character encoding to ensure that everything is accurately encoded and shown on all devices.</li> 

  <li style="padding: 1rem 0">Verify linguistic and cultural consistency: Make sure that all app components, including text, graphics, and sounds, are suitable from a culture standpoint and adhere to regional norms.</li> 

  <li style="padding: 1rem 0">Test the language switching capability of the app to ensure that users can quickly and simply switch between languages.</li> 
</ul>

Including an in-app feedback feature can be very beneficial, with research showing that it can increase feedback by <a href="https://instabug.com/blog/benefits-of-in-app-feedback-during-beta-testing/?src=InstabugBlog&mdm=internal&ref=mobile_app_localization" title="up to 750%">up to 750%</a>.

### 4)  	Publish your updates
Once your beta tests have been completed, it is time to publish your updates. This is the final step to getting your mobile app out there and being used by consumers. 

### 5)  	Bonus tip – read customer reviews and check analytics data
Of course, there is no better way to ensure that your app is the very best it can be than by reading customer reviews. This is your chance to see exactly what customers are thinking, allowing you to adapt the app accordingly. 

Your app analytics are an excellent location to look for potential growth directions. Determine where the majority of your consumers or loyal users originate from.

## How to find translators? <a name="translators"></a>
Comprehensive translation is essential to any localization process, but finding the right translator can be tough. There are several tips to remember when finding a translator, including:


#### 1)  	Background 
The first thing to do is to review their background. You want to ensure that your chosen translator has a proven history in your target language, either being a native speaker or has spent considerable time in that country. 
 
#### 2)  	Be clear  
When engaging with a translator, you should make sure that you are as clear and straightforward as possible. The more thorough you are with your instructions, the better your translator will be able to understand your requirements. 

#### 3)  	Ask for examples  
Another top tip when it comes to finding the very best translator possible is to ask for examples. Any professional translator will be happy to showcase their past work, allowing you to review their results.

However, it is essential that you are utilizing the right technology. Not having the right localization-tools can lead to poor results, so when it comes to finding the right localization technology, there are certain things you should look for:

-	A collaborative process that allows copywriters, designers, managers, and more, to work together. 
-	A solution that lets you reuse app strings and content, helping to save you time and money. 
-	A built-in glossary of mobile app terms to ensure consistency. 
-	Automation tools for tasks such as string extractions, performance monitoring, workflow management, and screenshot generation. 
-	Integration with other essential apps such as Slack and Jira.

## App-localization-tips: How to localize your app  <a name="tips"></a>
When it comes to app localization, there are several top tips to remember. The first is to ensure that you are being as comprehensive as possible in your beta testing. This will give you the knowledge and insight on what is working and what areas still need to be improved. 

You should also ensure that you are being as flexible as possible when it comes to adapting your mobile app into different languages. You also want to ensure that your app is able to support languages that read right-to-left and left-to-right, guaranteeing that it flows for readers no matter where in the world that they might be based. 

The support of numerous languages will also have a <b>favorable impact on the app store listing </b>.

Another helpful tip is to transfer strings from code to resource files. Because storing strings in resource files before deploying code allows the team to access those files for translation later without having to change the code. The team may access those files for translation without having to update the code itself.
