AI in Localization increases the quality of deliverables, accelerates time-to-market and increases consistency across languages and platforms, making the process faster, more accurate and more cost-effective.

Within AI in Localization, there are three specific sub-fields that are of particular importance in localization:

### Machine learning (ML)
The algorithms, trained on extensive data sets, improve the accuracy of translations and automate quality assessments by translation management systems.

### Deep Learning (DL)
An advanced form of machine learning, deep learning algorithms mimic the way the human brain works, enabling more accurate translations through neural machine translation (NMT).

### Natural language processing (NLP)
NLP enables computers to understand and use human language, improving <a href="/blog/localization" title="localization">localization</a> processes and the automated insertion of glossary terms.

Advanced AI in localization brings significant benefits to the localization industry by not only simplifying workflows but also significantly improving the quality of localization results. 

In particular, machine learning and deep learning make it possible to analyze complex data and derive more precise linguistic patterns, which are essential for more effective translations.


AI in Localization changes numerous localization projects:

- Increased efficiency: automation of routine tasks speeds up the process.
- Improved decision-making: Using predictive analytics to optimize project management.
- Increased accuracy: ensuring consistency and quality across languages and platforms.

In addition, natural language processing (NLP) enables deeper interaction with text by capturing nuanced aspects of language that are essential to human communication.

## What makes AI so interesting for companies besides AI in localization?
The importance and impact of AI on companies is remarkable given the rapid pace of technological development. 

Numerous brands from a wide range of industries have the opportunity to use artificial intelligence to improve their operations, increase efficiency and promote growth.

But what impact can the use of AI really have?

### Sales growth
Companies using AI report high average revenue growth compared to companies without AI. This shows the positive correlation between AI usage and increased revenue.

### Profitability
Companies implementing AI experience a greater average increase in profitability compared to those without AI, emphasizing the efficiency of AI in operations and decision making.
