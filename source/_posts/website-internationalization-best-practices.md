## Best practices in detail

### 1. Use as little text as possible in your pictures
Because you will end up uploading several images for the same piece or web content, as it has to be translated during the localization process. If you don't have any text in your image, there's no need to modify anything when it comes to localizing your website. Another possibility is to separate the text from the image. You may create a layer that will be placed on top of the image. Alternatively, make picture files easily accessible.

### 2. Separate code from translating
It seems logical to keep the code separate from the translation process. During the project, the developer may work freely without being interrupted by any colleagues. This way, you won't lose sight of the project and guarantee that no mistakes occur. This way you gather new content automatically and smoothly, posting it for translation, getting translations, and integrating them back into the product. When you use locize as a <a href="https://locize.com/" title="localization management platform">localization management platform</a>, this feature will be offered.

### 3. Consider different ways of pluralizing words
Various languages have different grammatical rules for dealing with plural nouns and units. Ensure to offer a separate translation for each plural form in the language when localizing formatted strings that include variable quantities. In Polish, for example, imagine you have a singular and then a plural depending on whether the number of objects ends with 2, 3, 4, or any other digit. And each collection of things more than 20 requires a separate plural in Romanian. Locize recognizes and accurately estimates your progress in the various languages by taking into account the various pluralization laws.

### 4. Check to see if the layout can support longer or shorter text
The fact is that translations can take longer than the original and go over the layout. So check in advance that your translation approach can support different size of language. Particularly in Europe, where various languages might have many more terms for the same statement. In this <a href="https://www.inter-contact.de/en/blog/text-length-languages?dt=1629440931092" title="blog post">blog post</a>, you will find a comparison of European languages with a table gives a very nice overview "how the languages are different". You may use the <a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/review-workflow" title="locize review workflow">locize review workflow</a> to guarantee that changes to translation are accepted before they are published. Until one of the translation proposals is approved, the real value will remain unchanged.

### 5. Make it easy to find strings
Strings should definitly not be directly in the code. Make it simple for developers to externalize their strings and include them in resource files from the beginning. This implies that any hard-coded strings will appear in their original language, regardless of the user's language. You will never face such problems again if you use translation management software such as locize. With the integrated search feature, translators may discover any string in seconds.

### 6. Set character encoding to UTF-8
Select an encoding that is compatible with all target languages. If you are unsure, simply select UTF-8. If you're wondering why UTF-8 is the greatest encoding, read on this <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-choosing-encodings.en" title="FAQ about UTF-8">FAQ about UTF-8</a>. To distinguish assets meant for a certain region, utilize ISO 693-1 & 3166-1 language and country codes to mark assets by locale.

### 7. Consider the colors also
In terms of user experience, the culture of your target consumer may make a significant difference. When creating your Webdesign, consider which markets you want to target. You want to leave a favorable impression on your target clients, not anything that will remind them of a terrible incident, political issue, or something similar. As a result, make it simple in your website. As a result, make it simple for your website to swap colors based on target country or region.
