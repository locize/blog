## Introduction to Localization Strategy<a name="what"></a>
A localization strategy tailors a company's market approach to accommodate the purchasing habits, customer behaviors, and cultural differences in each country it operates.

As the CTO, manager or tech lead of a fast-growing tech company, you're likely focused on maintaining a competitive edge and scaling your product to reach a global audience. 

However, localization can often be an afterthought in the [software development](../what-is-software-localization/) process, and the lack of a clear localization strategy can lead to delays, inconsistencies, and increased costs.

## The Need for a Localization Strategy<a name="why"></a>
Developing local leadership and skills in new markets can be challenging, with unexpected obstacles such as compliance with local laws. 

Therefore, globalization should be a gradual strategy, considering the real costs, time, and opportunities new markets present. <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/04/does-your-company-have-what-it-takes-to-go-global?ab=at_art_art_1x1" title="study of harvard business review">Harvard business review</a> studies show successful global companies adopt this approach.

Successful global companies operate by:

- Ensuring they possess the required expertise and skills.
- Aligning international opportunities with the company's goals and capabilities.
- Adapting marketing policies and processes to the opportunity.
- Maintaining legal and ethical standards with international flexibility.
- Promoting a culture tolerant of financial uncertainty and market fluctuations.
- Preparing thoroughly and accepting the occurrence of mistakes, which is essential for effective localization strategy.

➡️ Localization makes products fit better with local cultures and needs, helping to attract new customers more easily. This approach helps a company grow globally by being more relatable to different audiences.



## Challenges in Localization<a name="challenges"></a>

One of the key challenges in localization is **striking the balance** between **speed** and **quality**. 

On one hand, you want to get your product to market as quickly as possible, but on the other hand, you also want to ensure that your localized content is accurate, relevant, and culturally appropriate. 

To achieve this balance, it's essential to integrate localization early in the development process and to establish clear guidelines and processes for your localization team. Learn more [here](../localization-fun/).

Another challenge is **maintaining consistency** and **reducing costs** as your product and localization team scale. 

To tackle this, you can implement [automation](https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/auto-machine-translation) and [translation memory](https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/translation-memory) tools that can help to improve efficiency and reduce the need for manual translation and [review](https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/review-workflow).



## The Role of Collaboration in Localization<a name="collaboration"></a>

Involving all stakeholders, including product, development, and localization teams, in the localization process ensures consistent content and streamlines the process. A centralized [translation management system (TMS)](../tms/) facilitates this by supporting real-time translation delivery, version control, translation memory, and [team collaboration tools](https://docs.locize.com/more/notifications).

Locize serves as an effective solution for achieving these objectives. 

It is a user-friendly localization platform offering real-time translation, collaborative features, advanced options such as [versioning](https://docs.locize.com/more/versioning) and [translation memory](https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/translation-memory), and extensive [variety of integrations](https://docs.locize.com/integration/instrumenting-your-code) compatible with existing tools and workflows.

### 2. It improves branding's trust

### 4. It reduces customer churn
The number of consumers or subscribers who ceased using your product or service over a specific time period is referred to as your customer churn rate. The degree to which your product will satisfy customers and reduce customer turnover depends on a number of factors. 

Localization is helping to reduce overall churn in this situation. The most crucial factors, including language barriers, local customer habits, and cultural considerations, will be taken into account during localization of a business.
