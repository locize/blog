## LOCIZE - PRICING

<p class="headline">Free trial</p>

No credit card required...try us 14 days for free.

<p class="headline">Pay for use - not for arbitrary subscription plans</p>

We prefer a simple pricing model - you pay dependent on you usage:

<div class="pricing">
<table>
<tr>
<td>Basic Subscription <sup>1)</sup></td>
<td>$5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Per Word <sup>2)</sup></td>
<td>$0.008</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Per Download <sup>3)</sup></td>
<td>$0.0002</td>
</tr>
</table>
<small style="font-size: 0.6em; text-transform: none;">prices excl. VAT | billed on a recurring monthly basis</small>
</div>

<p class="headline">1) Basic subscription</p>

Will be billed monthly for basic service usage.

<p class="headline">2) Words</p>

When we charge your CreditCard for the basic subscription we will add an additional
invoice item. Words are count on billing day for every language - but will exclude any additional version of your translations.

<p class="headline">3) Downloads</p>

An additional invoice item will be generated on the monthly invoice based on the translation files downloaded to your users. We will charge always the last full month.

<p class="headline">invoice forecast / history</p>

On your projects billing page you will find your current usage stats and a forecast for downloads.

On the same page you're able to access your invoice history.
